# TutorMe Hybrid Application: Testing Plan

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the testing strategy, objectives, and procedures for the TutorMe Hybrid Application. The purpose of this plan is to ensure that all features of the application are working as expected, with a focus on both functional and non-functional testing.

---

## 2. Testing Objectives
The key objectives of the testing process are:
1. Verify that the core functionalities, such as video conferencing, chat, user management, and content sharing, work correctly.
2. Ensure the system performs well under varying loads and user activities.
3. Validate the security and data protection mechanisms, including user authentication and encryption.
4. Ensure the user interface (UI) is responsive and provides a smooth user experience on different devices.
5. Identify and fix any defects before production deployment.

## 3. Test Scope

### 3.1 **In Scope**
- **Functional Testing**
  - User authentication (registration, login, logout).
  - Video conferencing using WebRTC.
  - Real-time chat and whiteboard interaction via Socket.IO.
  - File upload and sharing.
  - User management (profile creation, roles, permissions).
  - API testing for all backend services.
  
- **Non-Functional Testing**
  - Performance testing (response times, concurrency, scalability).
  - Security testing (authentication, authorization, encryption).
  - Compatibility testing (browsers, devices, operating systems).

### 3.2 **Out of Scope**
- Future enhancements such as AI transcription and mobile applications are excluded from this testing cycle.

## 4. Test Types

### 4.1 **Functional Testing**
- **Unit Testing**: Test individual components of the frontend and backend. This includes testing React components, Express.js API endpoints, and database interactions.
- **Integration Testing**: Ensure that different components, such as frontend-backend communication, work together as expected. This includes testing WebSocket connections and REST API integrations.
- **End-to-End (E2E) Testing**: Test the entire user flow, from login to video conferencing, file sharing, and logout. Cypress or Selenium will be used for simulating user actions and validating system behavior.
  
### 4.2 **Non-Functional Testing**
- **Performance Testing**: Using tools like JMeter or Artillery to simulate load and measure the systemâ€™s response time and resource usage under high traffic conditions.
- ~~**Security Testing**: Check for vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, and ensure secure data storage. OWASP ZAP will be used for automated security scans.~~
- **Compatibility Testing**: Verify that the system functions correctly across different web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).

---

## 5. Test Environment

### 5.1 **Frontend Testing**
- **Environment**: Development and staging environments using Docker containers.
- **Browsers**: Chrome and Firefox
- **Devices**: Desktop, mobile, and tablets (responsive design testing).

### 5.2 **Backend Testing**
- **Environment**: Node.js environment running in Docker containers.
- **Databases**: Testing with both MySQL and MongoDB databases.
- **WebSockets**: Using test signaling servers for WebRTC and Socket.IO communications.

### 5.3 **Load and Performance Testing**
- Simulated in a staging environment that mirrors the production environment, using tools like JMeter or Artillery.
- Load balancers and Docker orchestration via Kubernetes will also be tested for scalability.

---

## 6. Test Data
- **User Data**: Simulated users for testing authentication, roles, and permissions (both valid and invalid credentials).
- **Session Data**: Test sessions for video conferencing, chat, and file sharing.
- **File Data**: Various file types (documents, images, videos) will be uploaded during testing to check for compatibility and upload limits.

## 9. Test Cases

### 9.1 **Authentication**
- **Test Case 1**: User registers with valid data.
  - **Expected Result**: User account is created, and JWT token is issued.
- **Test Case 2**: User logs in with invalid credentials.
  - **Expected Result**: Error message is displayed, and no token is issued.
  
### 9.2 **Video Conferencing**
- **Test Case 1**: User initiates a video session with one other participant.
  - **Expected Result**: Both users can see and hear each other with minimal lag.
  
### 9.3 **Chat Functionality**
- **Test Case 1**: Users send messages in a group chat.
  - **Expected Result**: Messages are instantly displayed for all participants.

---

## 10. Defect Management
- **Defect Tracking Tool**: Jira or GitHub Issues will be used to log, track, and prioritize defects.
- **Defect Lifecycle**: Defects will be categorized into `low`, `medium`, `high`, and `critical` based on impact. Critical defects will be addressed immediately, and regression tests will follow.
